        "# Agentic Medical RAG System for Hypertension Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "This project implements a lightweight, **agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** focused on explaining medical concepts, specifically hypertension. A key feature of this system is that it operates **without external API keys (like OpenAI) and avoids heavy NLP libraries like NLTK**, making it entirely free and self-contained. It leverages a multi-agent architecture to retrieve, generate, evaluate, and summarize information.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Title\n",
        "**Agentic Medical RAG System for Hypertension Explanation (No NLTK/API Keys)**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Internal Knowledge Base:** A static, predefined set of medical facts about hypertension.\n",
        "*   **External Knowledge Retrieval:** Integrates with Wikipedia for dynamic information retrieval, acting as an 'external' source.\n",
        "*   **Basic NLP Utilities:** Custom-built functions for tokenization and sentence splitting, avoiding heavy external dependencies.\n",
        "*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:**\n",
        "    *   **Planner Agent:** Orchestrates the flow of information by defining a sequence of steps.\n",
        "    *   **Retriever Agent:** Fetches relevant information from both internal KB and Wikipedia.\n",
        "    *   **Generator Agent:** Synthesizes retrieved information into a coherent answer.\n",
        "    *   **Critic Agent:** Evaluates the generated answer for quality, relevance, and completeness, triggering refinement if necessary.\n",
        "    *   **Summarizer Agent:** Condenses the final answer using basic NLP techniques.\n",
        "*   **Pure Python/No-API:** No reliance on expensive or external LLM APIs for core generation or complex NLP tasks.\n",
        "*   **Execution Trace:** Provides a detailed log of agent activities and decisions during the RAG process.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Architecture Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The system follows a sequential agentic workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Planning:** A `planner` agent defines the execution steps (retrieve internal, retrieve external, generate, evaluate, summarize).\n",
        "2.  **Retrieval:** The system first queries its `INTERNAL_MEDICAL_KB` and then fetches supplementary information from Wikipedia using `retrieve_wikipedia`.\n",
        "3.  **Generation:** A `generate_answer` function combines the retrieved internal and external documents to form a draft response.\n",
        "4.  **Critique & Refinement:** A `critic_agent` assesses the quality and completeness of the draft. If deemed insufficient, it might trigger a refinement step (e.g., adding more details from the KB).\n",
        "5.  **Summarization:** Finally, a `nlp_summarize` function condenses the (potentially refined) answer into a concise summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "This agentic loop allows for self-correction and ensures a more robust and informative output.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup and How to Run\n",
        "\n",
        "To set up and run this project, follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or copy the code into a Colab notebook.**\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Install the necessary libraries:**\n",
        "    The project primarily uses `wikipedia` and `re`. The `wikipedia` library is crucial for external knowledge retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```bash\n",
        "    !pip install wikipedia\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Execute the code:**\n",
        "    The core logic is contained within the `agentic_medical_rag` function. You can run the demo by defining a query and calling the function:\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    query = \"Explain the causes and risk factors of hypertension in simple terms.\"\n",
        "    final_answer = agentic_medical_rag(query)\n",
        "\n",
        "    print(\"\\n✅ FINAL ANSWER:\\n\")\n",
        "    print(final_answer)\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "    The script will print the step-by-step execution trace of the agents, followed by the final summarized answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "**Query:** `\"Explain the causes and risk factors of hypertension in simple terms.\"`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Expected Output Structure (simplified):**\n",
